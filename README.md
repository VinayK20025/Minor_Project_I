# Minor_Project_I
# A Computational Approach to Support Border Surveillance
# Aims to create an algorithm for the border forceâ€™s ideal patrol procedures. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi-Agent Modeling will be applied to the algorithm design. Grid systems will be used to partition the map. Route layout algorithms are being put into practice.
